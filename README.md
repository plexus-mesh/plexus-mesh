## 💠 What is Plexus?

**Plexus** is a decentralized, P2P-powered orchestration layer that transforms your local hardware into a private, high-performance AI powerhouse. 

Most AI today is a "black box" in the cloud. **Plexus breaks the cage.** It connects your laptop, gaming PC, and home server into a single, encrypted neural mesh—allowing you to share compute power and intelligence without ever leaking a single byte of data to Big Tech.

## ✨ Core Pillars

* **🛡️ Private by Design:** Zero-cloud dependency. Your data, your weights, your local execution.
* **🕸️ P2P Orchestration:** Powered by `libp2p`. Dynamic task routing between your devices.
* **🦀 Rust Engineered:** Blazing fast, memory-safe, and designed for low-power IoT up to high-end GPUs.
* **🧠 Collective Memory:** Shared, conflict-free state synchronization using CRDTs.
